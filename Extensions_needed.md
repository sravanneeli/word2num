1. I have created a small module for the task given.Basically I have created using OOPS concepts so if any new requirements are 
required we can make wraper functions for that.

2. The new things to be added are it doesn't support all currency symbols presently and for quotations part we have "Double/Triple/etc"
it doesn't support next level to change this we had to add them to dictionary.

3. There are some rules which we can add presently it only supports for money based speech text but we if we want to convert any any number in speech to number form we can just add another function but parsing technique will be different.Without disturbing any previous function we can add them and get the modified text

4. I used re module to identify the required text from the speech_text.
