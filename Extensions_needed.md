1.I have created a small module for the task given.Basically I have created using OOPS concepts so if any new requirements are 
required we can make wraper functions for that.

2.The new things to be added are it doesn't support all currency symbols presently and for quotations part we have "Double/Triple/etc"
it doesn't support next level to change this we had to add them to dictionary.
